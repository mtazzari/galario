**GPU Accelerated Library for Analysing Radio Interferometer Observations**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

|galario| is a library that exploits the computing power of modern graphic cards (GPUs) to accelerate the comparison of model
predictions to radio interferometer observations. Namely, it speeds up the computation of the synthetic visibilities
given a model image (or an axisymmetric brightness profile) and their comparison to the observations.

Along with the GPU accelerated version based on the
`CUDA Toolkit <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit>`_, |galario| offers a CPU counterpart accelerated with
`openMP <http://www.openmp.org>`_.

Modern radio interferometers like
`ALMA <http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/>`_ and the
`Karl G. Jansky VLA <https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla>`_,
are pushing to the extreme the computational efforts needed to model the observations.
The unprecedented sensitivity and resolution achieved by these observatories deliver huge amount of data that sample a wide range of spatial frequencies.
In this context, |galario| provides a fast library useful for comparing a model to observations directly in the Fourier plane.

We presented |galario| in `Tazzari, Beaujean and Testi (2018) MNRAS 476 4527 <https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/sty409>`_, where you can find all the details about the
relevant equations and the algorithm implementation.

.. Here we do not aim to summarize the vast literature about Radio Interferometry, but we refer the interested reader to the `Synthesis Imaging in Radio Astronomy II <http://aspbooks.org/a/volumes/table_of_contents/180>`_ book.

|galario| is actively developed on `GitHub <https://github.com/mtazzari/galario/>`_
and has already been employed in :doc:`these publications <publications>`.

.. note:: The Python and C++ bindings of |galario| can be installed easily via `conda <https://conda.io>`_:

    .. code-block:: bash

       conda install -c conda-forge galario

    Due to technical limitations, the conda package does not support GPUs at the
    moment. If you want to use a GPU, you have to build |galario| by hand.

    All the details on how to build and install |galario| can be found in the :doc:`Setup <install>` page.


Basic functionality of |galario|: see the :doc:`Basic Usage <basic_usage>` page.

How to fit some data with |galario|: check the :doc:`Getting started example <quickstart>`.

Details on image orientation, coordinate systems and other assumptions: see the :doc:`Technical specifications <tech-specs>`.

Useful recipes for the CPU/GPU management and the model image creation: see the :doc:`Cookbook <cookbook>` with many code snippets.

Detailed documentation of each Python and C++ function: see the :doc:`Python-API <py-api>` and :doc:`C++ API <C++-api>` pages.
